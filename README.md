# The UMSWEB
This repo is mostly an archive to the UMSWEB, and all the batch files once accessible on it. A few notable highlights:

## The IGTNET Launcher

This batch file would automatically launch after logging in to the UMSWEB via SSH. It served as an informative program hub for users of the system. It's also what was eventually replaced by [Landingpad](https://github.com/igtampe/airportboard)

## TEBECON

Tebecon was the start of the UMS economy, and the main program people connected to the UMSWEB for. Through it, users could write bills and checks to each other, and manage their pecunias (the virtual currency of the UMS), along with their bank accounts in the three major banking institutions of the UMS. This program was later suplemented and surpassed by [ViBE](https://github.com/igtampe/vibe). ViBE was originally meant as an alternate way of accessing TEBECON, and was fully backwards compatible for a time. Even after breaking from the check system, users could still view accounts through Tebecon (albeit restricted by its lack of 64-bit integer processing). It was only later that the UMS economy broke fully from TEBECON, with its total rewrite presented in [Neco](https://github.com/igtampe/neco)

## ITOS

ITOS was supposed to be an homage and next generation to [Igtampe DOS](https://github.com/igtampe/igtampedos). It was mostly a showcase of some of the graphical utilities I had come to know and use in the rest of the UMSWEB ecosystem. Notably, ITOS's dialog boxes would later be used as inspirations for the TUI dialog boxes used in [BasicWindows](https://github.com/igtampe/basicrender)
